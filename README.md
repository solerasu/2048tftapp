2048 Teamfight Tactics Application to RIOT for the approval

<p>2048 TFT is 2048 game in TeamFight Tactics style. It's like a puzzle that allows people to remember the appearance of objects from the original TFT game, as well as to look at TFT from different angles.</p>
<p><i>Just in case, if suddenly you did not play the original 2048: You must swipe to move all tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one. Get to the 2048 tile and then reach your highest score.</i></p>
<p>The best results are implemented using the Google Play Leaderboards for each of the modes (4x4, 5x5, 6x6) separately.</p>
<b>I did not use APIs.</b>
<p>I used in the application pictures of: TFT items, Little Legends, Rare Eggs, Victory/Defeat emblems and also several sounds from TFT mobile version.</p>
<p>Little Legends does not affect the gameplay, they are just for beauty, to amuse the player and help him to feel the atmosphere of TFT even better.
I want to add that people like to play this game, this application received nice feedback.</p>
<p><b>I attach screenshots, also you can watch video trailer here: https://youtu.be/Zkdi5bkjpuA </b></p>
<p>Please check my application. Waiting for the approval.
Best wishes,  Yevhenii</p>
